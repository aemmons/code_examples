###averageDay.py and instantDay.py

These programs process TIFF images and create a final image. The instantDay.py program creates an image from taking vertical slices of pixels from the input images. The averageDay.py program creates an image where each pixel is an average of all the pixels in that location for all input images.

###bin_idx_tree.py

This example uses a binary index tree algorithm to process video view logs. It finds two counts, the number of unique users who watched at least n videos, and the number of unique users who watched exactly n videos.

###flask_views.py

These are base class views for Flask projects. They are inspired by Django class-based views. I like this approach because you can implement generalized simple functionality and built complex functionality via subclassing and Python's class inheritance.

###froalaEmbedTweet.js

Example of a javascript module. Froala is a WYSIWYG editor and this is a plugin for it that creates the ability to embed tweets into the body of the editor.
